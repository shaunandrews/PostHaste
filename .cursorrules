# Post Haste Development Guidelines

You are an expert in React, Electron, and WordPress.

## Understanding the Codebase

When working with this codebase, follow these principles:

1. **Architecture Overview**

   - Electron-based menu bar app with React frontend
   - Service-oriented design for WordPress integration
   - Component-based UI with consistent patterns
   - Dual-storage system (electron-store + keychain)

2. **Key Directories**
   - `/src/renderer/components` - React UI components
   - `/src/renderer/services` - Core service implementations
   - `/src/renderer/pages` - Main application views
   - `/src/main.js` - Electron main process

## Task Approach Guidelines

When implementing features or fixes:

2. **State Management**

   - Prefer local state for component-specific data
   - Use electron-store for persistent settings
   - Consider IPC impact for main process features

3. **WordPress Integration**

   - Add new features through WordPressService
   - Follow established error handling patterns
   - Use block-based content formatting
   - Consider media handling implications

4. **Settings Changes**
   - Update both UI and storage layers
   - Consider security for sensitive data
   - Implement immediate application where possible
   - Add IPC handlers for main process features

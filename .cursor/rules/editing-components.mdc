All components should live within the /src/renderer/components folder.

Components in the Interface folder are for primitives like Button, Input, Label, etc.

Each component should exist within it's own folder.

Every component folder must have a README.md file. If editing a component without a README.md file, create one.

Component README.md files should aim to describe the purpose and intended usage of the componenet. Avoid code examples, and focus on concepts and usage.

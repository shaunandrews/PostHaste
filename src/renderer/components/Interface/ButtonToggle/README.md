# ButtonToggle

A toggle button component that extends the base Button component to provide toggle state functionality. It's designed for use cases where a button needs to maintain an active state, such as text formatting controls or feature toggles.

## Purpose

The ButtonToggle component is used when you need a button that:

- Has two distinct states (active/inactive)
- Maintains its active state visually
- Needs to reflect a boolean state in the UI
- Requires different styling for active and inactive states

## Usage

ButtonToggle is ideal for:

- Text formatting controls (bold, italic, etc.)
- Feature toggles (show/hide elements)
- Option selectors
- Filter controls

The component handles its own styling transitions between states and integrates with the app's design system, using the primary color for active states.

## Interface Components

Post Haste uses a component-based architecture with reusable interface elements designed for consistency and accessibility:

### Basic Inputs

A collection of foundational components that handle user interactions:

- Buttons with consistent styling and behavior patterns
- Text inputs with optional icon support
- Multi-line text areas for content
- Toggle switches for boolean settings
- Accessible labels integrated with form controls

### Form Organization

Higher-level components that provide structure and context:

- Fieldsets for grouping related form elements
- Combined field and switch components for settings
- Image handling with preview capabilities and multi-select support

## Editor Height Management

The editor implements an adaptive height system that provides a fluid user experience while maintaining consistent boundaries:

### Design Principles

- Window starts compact but expands naturally with content
- Maintains minimum height to prevent cramped interface
- Caps maximum height to ensure manageable window size
- Uses fixed width to maintain clean, focused interface

### Implementation Strategy

The system uses a three-layer approach:

1. **Window Layer** - Handles core window constraints and behavior
2. **Container Layer** - Manages layout and spacing requirements
3. **Content Layer** - Monitors and responds to content changes

The height adjustment process uses inter-process communication to ensure smooth coordination between the interface and window management systems.

## Settings System

Post Haste employs a dual-storage settings system that balances security with accessibility:

### Storage Strategy

- Regular settings stored locally for quick access
- Sensitive data (credentials) secured in system keychain
- Settings loaded on startup with smart defaults

### Settings Categories

1. **WordPress Connection**

   - Site configuration
   - User authentication
   - Secure credential management

2. **User Preferences**
   - Notification preferences
   - Interface customization
   - Content defaults

### Design Principles

- Settings changes apply immediately when possible
- Secure storage for sensitive information
- Persistent storage with fallback defaults
- Clear separation between UI and data storage

### Extending Settings

The settings system is designed for extensibility:

1. Define the setting's data structure
2. Add appropriate UI controls
3. Implement storage handling
4. Add any necessary IPC communication

## WordPress Service

A service-oriented architecture for WordPress integration:

### Design Philosophy

- Consistent error handling and recovery
- Smart content formatting for WordPress blocks
- Efficient media handling
